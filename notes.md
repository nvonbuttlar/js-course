# 1.0 + 2.0 Welcome and JS Fundamentals pt.1

## Javascript History
- ES6/ES2015 biggest update to the language EVER
- ES = ECMAScript
- ES6 onwards is Modern Javascript
- New updates every year

## Data Types
- Number: Floating point numbers
- String
- Boolean
- Undefined: Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value')
- Null: Empty value
- Symbol: Value that is unique and cannot be changed [not useful now apr.11, 2022]
- BigInt: Larger integrers than the Number type can hold
- JS has dynamic typing: We do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. 
- Data types are determined automatically

# 3.0 JS Fundamentals pt.2
- Arrow functions
- Calling a function in another function
- Function expression vs Function declaration
- The main difference between a function expression and a function declaration is the function name, which can be omitted in function expressions to create anonymous functions.
- Objects, Arrays, and methods for both

- At the beggining of each section there is a flag that says either
1. Very important
2. Good to know
3. Optional 
- These are important as there is stil 50 hours of video left, not all of which is necessary.
- I'm leaning toward pathway 3. Only projects with UI. 
- I know the fundamentals and want to use them to do bigger projects as practice.

# 5.0 Dev skills & setup
- Setup is already complete
- How to think like a developer
- STAY CALM. SLOW DOWN. 
- Take a logical, and rational approach. Programming is just logic. 
- 4 step framework to solve any problem: 
  1. Make sure you 100% understand the problem. Ask the right questions to get a clear picture. 
  2. Divide and conquer. Break a big problem into smaller sub-problems. Make a task list.
  3. First try to solve problem. And then - RESEARCH. Google. MDN. StackOverflow.
  4. For bigger problemsm write psuedo code before writing actual code.

- Discover a genuine curiosty for how things work.
