# 1.0 + 2.0 Welcome and JS Fundamentals pt.1

## Javascript History
- ES6/ES2015 biggest update to the language EVER
- ES = ECMAScript
- ES6 onwards is Modern Javascript
- New updates every year

## Data Types
- Number: Floating point numbers
- String
- Boolean
- Undefined: Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value')
- Null: Empty value
- Symbol: Value that is unique and cannot be changed [not useful now apr.11, 2022]
- BigInt: Larger integrers than the Number type can hold
- JS has dynamic typing: We do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. 
- Data types are determined automatically

# 3.0 JS Fundamentals pt.2
- Arrow functions
- Calling a function in another function
- Function expression vs Function declaration
- The main difference between a function expression and a function declaration is the function name, which can be omitted in function expressions to create anonymous functions.
